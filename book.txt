Sure! Here's an original short story of approximately **1000 words**, titled **“The Last Signal.”**

**The Last Signal**

The year was 2137. Earth had long since become inhospitable, not from war, but from neglect. The oceans had swallowed cities, the forests were gone, and the air was a cocktail of chemicals no filter could completely clean. Humanity had fled to the stars.

But not all.

In the dusty plains of what was once eastern India, a lone radio tower stood tall. Its paint was chipped, its metal bones rusted, but it still blinked a weak red light every few seconds—like a heartbeat refusing to quit.

Inside a small control hut beneath the tower, sat **Ishan**, a wiry, middle-aged man with graying stubble and thick glasses. He adjusted the frequency dial with the same gentle care he used to comb his daughter's hair—back when she was alive.

“CQ... CQ... This is Station Delta-9, Earth frequency. Do you copy?” he spoke into the microphone, voice steady despite years of silence in return. Static answered him, as always.

He logged the attempt into his dusty notebook. **Day 7,392. No response.**
He didn’t stop. He couldn’t.

Ishan was once an engineer with the Indian Space Surveillance Corps. When the Exodus began, he had helped guide the final wave of colony ships into orbit. Most of his colleagues left on the last shuttle. Ishan stayed behind—not out of duty, but grief. His wife and daughter had died during a botched early evacuation years before. With nothing to follow, he anchored himself to the only task that gave him purpose—**maintaining Earth’s last signal tower**.

Every day he sent a message. A greeting. A hope.

---

One evening, as the sky glowed with amber from solar storms, something unusual happened.

His signal meter flickered.

He blinked. At first, he assumed it was interference, but then—clearer than any sound he had heard in years—a voice crackled through.

> “...Delta-9, repeat your message. This is *Artemis Colony-4*. Do you copy?”

Ishan froze. His hand trembled as he reached for the mic.

> “This is Delta-9! I... I copy! You’re real. You’re out there!”

Static.

Then: “Affirmative, Delta-9. We’re conducting long-range scans. Your transmission pierced a collapsed comm corridor. We didn’t think anyone was still on Earth.”

Ishan blinked hard. His chest tightened—not in fear, but overwhelming relief.

> “I’m alive,” he whispered. “And I’ve been sending a message... every single day.”

The voice on the other end paused. Then softly said, “We received them. All at once. Like a memory catching up.”

---

Over the next few weeks, Ishan and the crew of Artemis Colony-4 spoke often. Her name was **Commander Elise Rao**, a second-generation spaceborn with roots from Mumbai. Her voice was calm, her questions gentle. She was fascinated by Earth, by Ishan’s resilience.

He told her about the dry rivers, the silent birds, the occasional sighting of lone wolves in what used to be Himachal.

In return, she told him of floating cities orbiting Neptune, of artificial rain clouds over Mars, of children born in zero-G who dreamed of oceans they’d never seen.

“We thought Earth was dead,” Elise admitted one night.

“She’s not dead,” Ishan replied. “She’s wounded. Forgotten. But she’s still breathing.”

---

Then came the storm.

Not just any storm—a **solar flare**, massive and angry. Elise warned him three days in advance.

“Our scans show you’ll be right in its path. That tower... it won’t survive.”

Ishan looked up at the structure he had lived beneath for two decades. The rust, the fatigue, the leaning steel. It had stood longer than it should.

“I know.”

“You should leave. We can dispatch a drone pod. It’ll take time, but—”

“No,” Ishan said quietly. “If I leave now, the signal dies.”

“You’ll die too.”

There was silence between them. Then Ishan’s voice, soft but unshaken.

> “Maybe. But Earth deserves someone to say goodbye properly.”

---

The flare came like a wave of fire.

Ishan spent his last hours writing. Not on a keyboard, but by hand. A letter. A memory. He described the scent of rain on soil, the laughter of his daughter when she played in puddles, the way his wife used to hum while making chai. He tucked the pages into a sealed container, marked it with coordinates, and placed it beneath the control desk.

Then he returned to the mic.

> “This is Delta-9, final transmission. The flare will hit soon. If you’re listening... don’t forget us. Don’t forget Earth. She was beautiful once. She can be again.”

The tower’s red light blinked once more.

Then darkness.

---

Three months later, a drone landed at the coordinates Elise had stored.

The tower was gone. The hut, scorched. But the container remained.

Inside was the letter, perfectly intact.

It now sits in the **Museum of Origins**, aboard **Artemis Prime**, beneath a plaque that reads:

> “**The Last Signal** – From the man who reminded us Earth was not a relic, but a memory worth saving.”

And far above the lifeless planet, the children of the stars began plans for their return.
